Summary:
  A simple CLI utility to overclock AMD GPUs.  Small, straightforward, and easy
  to use and modify.

  init starts script -> reads from input -> writes to sysfs files

Warning:
  Research your own GPU and adjust the .conf file as needed before running this
  utility.  Instability and damage can occure due to overclocking.

Usage:
  amdgpuoc [file|-]

  Calling amdgpuoc with no arguments uses the system-wide .conf file.
  Specifying an argument as '-' uses STDIN for input.  Any other arguments are
  treated as user-specified .conf files.

Requirements:
  An AMD GPU
  Linux kernel >= 4.20
  Kernel parameter amdgpu.ppfeaturemask=0xffffffff
  POSIX awk
  systemd

Installation:
  # add kernel parameter to grub config and reboot.
  make install
  systemctl enable amdgpuoc
  systemctl start amdgpuoc

Configuration:
  Configuration is done by editing /etc/amdgpuoc.conf.  See the sample .conf
  file for details.
