Summary:
  A simple CLI utility to overclock AMD GPUs.  Small, simple, and easy to use
  and modify.  Interacting with the sysfs by hand is tedious.  This utility
  makes that easier without becoming too complicated in itself.

  init starts script -> reads from input -> writes to sysfs files

  For more information about the amdgpu.ppfeaturemask parameter:
  drivers/gpu/drm/amd/include/amd_shared.h from the kernel source tree.

Warning:
  Research your own GPU and adjust the .conf file as needed before running this
  utility.  Instability and damage can occure due to overclocking.  Not all AMD
  GPUs can be overclocked in this manner.

Usage:
  amdgpuoc [files|-]

  Calling amdgpuoc with no arguments uses the system-wide .conf file.
  Specifying an argument as '-' uses STDIN for input.  Any other arguments are
  treated as user-specified .conf files.

Requirements:
  An AMD GPU
  Linux kernel >= 4.20
  Kernel parameter amdgpu.ppfeaturemask=0xffffffff
  POSIX awk
  systemd

Installation:
  vi /etc/default/grub
  # Append amdgpu.ppfeaturemask=0xffffffff to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT value.
  # Save and exit vi.
  grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
  make install
  systemctl enable amdgpuoc
  systemctl start amdgpuoc

Configuration:
  Configuration is done by editing /usr/local/etc/amdgpuoc.conf.  See the sample
  .conf file for details.
